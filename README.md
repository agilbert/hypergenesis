# Hypergenesis *for osx*

Hypergenesis is a simple bash script to get your OSX machine up and running as quickly as possible. 

It's designed around the assumption that (1.) most of you configuration settings are handled by some sort of dotfiles repository and (2.) any complicated development setup is done with vagrant in a VM.

## Run it

1. Install XCode
2. Tweak the script to your needs. *(Most of the configuration is in variables at the top)*
3. Run `sh hypergenesis.sh`

I recommend forking the script and tweaking it. It's a simple script that only covers so much. You know what you need.

## What does it do?

1. Installs `homebrew`
2. Using homebrew, installs a bunch of useful tools like `git grc coreutils ack findutils gnu-tar`
3. Sets up your .dotfiles
  * You'll definitely want to tweak this. My repo is based off of [holmans dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) 
4. Installs [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), then install node 0.10
5. Installs several useful DMG'ed apps
  * chrome
  * virtualbox
  * vagrant
  * dropbox
  * onepassword
  * sublimetext2
  * evernote

## Describe to me hypergenesis's genesis

I'm a big fan of devops. Using code to predictably and repeatedly configure servers is a wonderful thing. So like many nerds, I was excited to see [boxen](https://www.github.com/boxen) show up for development machine management. After throwing myself against the rocks several multiple times, I finally gave up in frustration. Frankly, Iâ€™m tired of frameworks and working against all the opinions of opinionated software. So, I have a simple script that sets up what I need, installs my dotfiles which sets up the rest and then installs vagrant which give me a dev environment.
